Usually Recursion for:
"Write code to compute the nth..."
"Design an algorithm to list the first n..."

Bottom-Up Approach:
multiple previous cases

Top-Down Approach:
divide the problem for case N into subproblems

Half-and-Half Approach:
dividing the data set in half 

Recursive call stack - O(n) memory
